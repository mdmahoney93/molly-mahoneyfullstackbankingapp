# Project Title: MDM Banking Application

## Description/Motivation:

This is a Full Stack Development project that was made with MERN Stack, using Create React App, styling with Bootstrap, and utlizing HTML, CSS, JS (React, Express, Node) and MongoDB.

The purpose of this app, aside from presenting my knowledge of how to create a full stack application, is to use this fictional but interactive banking system to create an account, deposit and withdrawl "money" and then see your balance.

Even though this is a fictional bank, it is secure and mimics the "real deal" so that I and developers alike can have a entry level idea of the amazing things you can create with the knowledge of software development.

There are multiple pages but all can lead back to the home page, either by clicking on the Home Icon in the top left corner, or select HOME from the Navagation Bar at the top of the page.

Step 1: Create Account (or Login using Premade Accounts; see Premade Accounts below) -
Once you click on the Create Account link at the NavBar, enter your First Name, Last Name, a valid Email, and Password. You can take a peek at your password with the little eye icon. If you need start over, select the Reset button or select the Submit button if you are good to go.
A box will appear that asks if you want to create another account or go to login page. Login with the credentials you just created and you're in! Feel free to check your balance.. but chances are its ZERO ;)
\*Once signed in to an account, you will notice that the account holders name is shown at the top... as well as an option to log out.  
Step 2: Make a Deposit -
Go to the top nav bar and select Deposit. Type in the amount you would like to deposit and click Make A Deposit
Transactions are shown to the right.  
Step 3: Make a Withdrawl -
Go to the top nav bar and select Deposit. Type in the amount you would like to deposit and click Make a Withdrawal. \*Note: if you wish to take out more than your account balance, you will be prompted to put in another amount. Transactions are shown to the right.  
Step 4: Check your Balance -
Your balance is shown at every deposit and withdrawl, but it can also be found at the top nav bar.  
Step 5: AllData -
This is specifically what makes this a "Bad" Bank.. Going to this tab will show you all the data of the users at this bank.. emails, passwords, balances, etc.

Login / Create an account using one of the pre-made accounts above

### Features:

Features include icons from react-icons, UI created with bootstrap styles, and had fun making the pages come to life with HTML CSS & JS.
For future, I would like to a transfer feature where you can transfer from user to user. I think it would also be useful to have multiple accounts per user (i.e. credit, checking, saving)
